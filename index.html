    <h2>Heya!</h2>
    <h3>Nice to meet ya!</h3>
    <p>I’ve been working as a freelance graphic designer for the last 7 years. In 2018, I decided to extend my skills to the world of development. I was fortunate to be selected to start a 3 month internship at 8th Light, where I  learned the basics of back-end programming.</br></br>At the beginning of April, I met a few of the Founders & Coders apprentices at a Codebar meet-up. They introduced me to the Founders & Coders community and I really enjoy it. I want to be a part of the club!
    </br><br>The bootcamp angle of learning JavaScript makes complete sense in regards to my design background, and naturally I’ve decided to apply here.</br></br>The concept of learning from the previous cohort is fantastic. Pairing and mobbing with fellow apprentices is a great opportunity to learn from and teach others, as well as moving forward together.</br></br>PS: The people I’ve met from Founders & Coders are great, and the place is awesome too! I’m looking forward to hearing from you!
