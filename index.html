    <h4>I'm Sarah! Nice to meet ya!</h4>
    <p>I’ve been working as a freelance graphic designer for the last 7 years. In 2018, I wanted to extend my skills to the world of development. I was fortunate to be chosen to start an internship of 3 months in a company name 8th Light, to learn the basics of back-end programming. Since then, I want to be a part of the club! In the beginning of April, I meet few of the apprentices of Founders & Coders in a workshop meeting at Codebar. The following Monday, they introduce me to the Founders & Coders workshop and I really enjoy it. The bootcamp angle of learning JavaScript make completely sense in regard of my design background and it’s naturally that I decided to apply here.  The concept of learning from the previous cohort is fantastic, as the pairing and mobbing the fellows apprentices to be together to get better.</br>
ps: The people and the place are awesome!  I’m looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
